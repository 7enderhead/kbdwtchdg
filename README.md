# kbdwtchdg
## Short definition
V-USB-based watchdog that identifies itself as a USB keyboard and sends keyboard strokes.

## What can I expect kbdwtchdg to do?
It sends a defined message via USB to the computer. It does that either after a specific period of time after being plugged in,
or after a capslock trigger (pressing capslock x times). 

## How to use
The repo contains an AtmelStudio 7 project file that is preconfigured for kbdwtchdg. 
Just select your programmer and load the project onto your Microcontroller.
Under /images you can find a circuit diagramm and photos of the project.
